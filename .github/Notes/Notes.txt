for question 2, it depends also on how the staff member reacts, how I'm doing, ect.
And, I constantly do it, so for trying to do it i'm probally  advanced. But, for actually succeeding... also, where's one that's between Developing and Proficient?

for question three, uh... anyways... (reason it's not the lowest is, for instance, times where I have removed some features that I know could work, but are taking way too long)

For question 5, I am doing it (so working on it, quite high). Stay on assigned tasks... well, if anything it's getting worse

For question 18, I know how to, I just don't always do it. For instance, a lot of recursive if-then-else's, as I could do it, I just don't necessarily...

for question 14, i'll reply with a question: people don't do that?

For 15, I don't know all of them (like breakpoints), but I do use the information using that "play button" thing

haven't done methods yet.

you kidding? question 20 is partly why I take so long...
